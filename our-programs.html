        <p>
        Our projects are designed to widen participation, increase educational and employment opportunities for people with disabilities 
        through the use of Assistive Technology. 
        Alongside with community workers in different areas of Rwanda, 
        RATA intervenes in 4 areas which are: 
        “Raising Awareness and Advocacy on the use and importance of Assistive technology, 
        Capacity development, Inclusive education and Innovation.”

            <h2 class="title">Community Outreach and Public Awareness</h2>
            <p>
                RATA intervenes in this area as many people in Rwanda are not yet aware enough of the importance of Assistive Technology 
                in the lives of persons with disabilities. 
                It’s done through meetings, workshops, awareness campaigns and consultations among private and public institutions, schools and 
                the general community. 
                RATA also plans to use innovative and various channels to pass appropriate messages during awareness and advocacy campaigns. 
                In February 2024, Accessible free online courses on Assistive Technology were introduced on our website, to primarily make 
                sure many people in Rwanda are aware enough of the importance of Assistive Technology in the lives of persons with disabilities.

            <h2 class="title">Capacity Development and Facilitating Access to Assistive Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Public and private institutions, schools, persons with disabilities, their caretakers and parents should be equipped with skills and 
                knowledge on Assistive Technology in order to widen participation, increase educational and employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. 
                The high cost of Assistive Technologies and their availability is another challenge that RATA tackles on.

            <p>
                To enhance Inclusive education, Assistive Technology plays a great role as it provides special educational needs software, switches, 
                computer access devices, communication aids for learners with disabilities. Teachers and other professionals involved in supporting children 
                with disabilities should be equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills on Assistive Technology in order to ensure that the classroom is inclusive. 
                Under the project called: “Accessible digital content for persons with disabilities”,
                RATA is training teachers in inclusive and special schools on how to prepare accessible digital content for their students.

            <p>
              This is the area where we believe Assistive Technology can make a great impact in improving the lives of 
              persons with disabilities. Local Assistive Technology tools need to be created.

                Under our Inclusive Tech Lab, we have an inclusive educational platform for technology designed for persons 
                with disabilities and a resource centre for Assistive Technology. The lab also serves as a platform where persons 
                with disabilities grow in tech while learning, collaborating, 
                connecting and innovating their local and affordable Assistive Technologies that meet their needs.
